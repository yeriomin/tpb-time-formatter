# The Pirate Bay Upload Time Fromatter

tpb's torrent upload time format irritates me. The time is in GMT+0 in torrent lists and GMT+1(CET) in comments. And "Today" and "Y-day" are not convinient at all.

This userscript formats all upload times uniformly and uses browser's timezone to print them. This makes lists a lot more readable in my opinion.

Default format is "dd.MM.yy HH:mm".

To install:
* Install a greasemonkey extension ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/violent-monkey/))
* Drag-and-drop the script to the greasemonkey dashboard
* Reload tpb page
